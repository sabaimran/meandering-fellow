    Leave some decisions to randomness to encourage exploration and reduce decision fatigue.

    <ul>
        <li>
            If you want to explore a city, randomize the next bookstore or park you visit.<br />
            You'll get to see those nooks and crannies of the city you wouldn't ordinarily visit.<br /><br />
        </li>

        <li>
            If you want to reduce decision fatigue, and take a break from an ever-increasing set of choices.<br />
            Tradeoff optimization for exploration and reduced decisions.<br />
            Randomize the next restaurant, bar or coffee shop you visit.<br />
        </li>
    </ul>
