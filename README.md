## Introduction
> Increase Exploration, Reduce Decisions üö∂‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è

It's fruitful to leave some decisions to randomness, it encourages exploration and reduces decision fatigue.

- If you want to explore a city, randomize the next bookstore or park you visit.
  You'll get to see those nooks and crannies of the city you wouldn't ordinarily visit.

- If you want to reduce decision fatigue, and take a break from an ever-increasing set of choices.
  Tradeoff a bit of optimization for exploration and reduced decisions.
  Randomize the next restaurant, bar or coffee shop you visit.


Meandering Fellow gives random location recommendations based on the visible area in the map. You can look for places like restaurants, bars, coffee shops, bookstores or parks.

All of the logic for this app is purely being processed on the client side üôÇ. For any comments or suggestions, add an issue. I'm actively monitoring for feature requests, suggestions, or bugs.
